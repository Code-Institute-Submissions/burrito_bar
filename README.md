# burrito_bar

## Overview

The Burrito Bar app is my project for stream one of the code institute full stack developer program. 
Burrito Bar is a mexican themed restaurant website, created using the angularJS framework. Prospective users, can browse menus, make reservations online & even register for access to discounted prices.

## Project requirements/ guidelines

I have incorporated many techniques and practises of the languages learned throughout stream one. 
Including HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Boostrap library for navigation, layout etc. to produce a fully responsive site,
that is compatible with any device.

I believe that this project fully satisfies the project guidelines, it particularly demonstrates use of HTML form validation, services, directives and angular routing.

## Tech

### Here are a few of the technologies used in the project:

- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
    - **AngularJS** is used for url routing, services & directives
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    - **Bootstrap** for navigation, responsive layout etc.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
    - **npm** to help manage the dependencies in the application
- [bower](https://bower.io/)
    - **Bower** is used to manage the installation of our libraries etc.
