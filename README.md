# burrito_bar

The Burrito Bar app is my project for stream one of the code institute full stack developer program. 
Burrito Bar is a ficticious, mexican themed restaurant, created using the angularJS framework. Prospective users, can browse menus,
make reservations online & even register for access to discounted prices.

I have incorporated many techniques and practises of the languages learned throughout stream one. 
Including HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Boostrap library for navigation, layout etc. to produce a fully responsive site,
that is compatible with any device.

I believe that this project fully satisfies the project guidelines, it particularly demonstrates use of HTML form validation, services, directives and angular routing.

The site is hosted live (for demonstration only) at https://burrito-bar-7b5ea.firebaseapp.com/
